# MobileUp CMP Template 🌀


Hi! This is a template for initializing an Compose Multiplatform project in [MobileUp](https://mobileup.ru/).

## Creating Project

After cloning the template:

1. Run the setup script to configure your application ID and JIRA key:  
   `./scripts/setup-project <new.application.id> <JIRA_PROJECT_KEY>`
2. Update `AGENTS.md` for your concrete product context.
3. Replace application name and icon with project-specific assets.
4. Remove the demo `pokemons` feature and related wiring.
5. Replace error text resources with product text.
6. Build a project-specific `CustomTheme` and reusable widget set in `core`.
7. Continue with product feature implementation.

Notes:
- `setup-project` also runs Git history reset and hook setup scripts.
- If needed separately, history reset script is: `./scripts/reset-git-history`.

## Modules
The project is based on three gradle modules:

#### core
It contains general purpose things: error handing, message showing, network, theme, utils, reusable widgets.

#### features
It consists of concrete features. Each feature has its own package which contains:
- DI configuration
- **presentation layer** - components, Compose UI
- **domain layer** - entities, queries, pure functions
- **data layer** - repositories, storages

#### shared
It combines all features and provides the `SharedApp` entry point for platform apps.

#### androidApp
Android entry points, icon resources, build configurations, Android-specific integrations, and launch of `shared`.

#### iosApp
Xcode project, SwiftUI entry point, assets, iOS-specific integrations, and launch of `shared`.
