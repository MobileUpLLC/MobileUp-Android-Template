# MobileUp Android Template ðŸŒ€


Hi! This is a template for initializing an Android project in [MobileUp](https://mobileup.ru/).

## Creating Project

After cloning the template:

1. Replace `ru.mobileup.template` with the package name of your project.
2. Replace application name and icon to the correct ones.
3. Remove the pokemons feature. It is created as an example.
4. Replace error text resources with text for your project.

Or simply run the setup script:

`bash scripts/setup-project <new.application.id> <JIRA_PROJECT_KEY>`

This will:

* Rename the package
* Reset Git history
* Set up Git hooks for Detekt and commit message formatting

## Modules
The project is based on three gradle modules:

#### app
It pieces all the features together, contains `Application` and `Activity` classes.

#### core
It contains general purpose things: error handing, message showing, network, theme, utils, reusable widgets.

#### features
It consists of concrete features. Each feature has its own package which contains:
- DI configuration
- **ui layer** - components, Jetpack Compose UI
- **domain layer** - entities, interactors
- **data layer** - repositories, storages

## Features structure

## Technology stack
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - UI
- [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) - componentization and navigation
- [Replica](https://github.com/aartikov/Replica) - organizing of network communication
- [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) - Dependency Injection
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) - Network
- [Ktorfit](https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit) - network requests in Retrofit way
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - asynchronous operations
- [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) - JSON serialization and parsing
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - image loading
- [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) - static code analysis
- [Hyperion](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/Hyperion-Android) - debug panel
- [Module Graph Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/MobileUpLLC/Module-Graph-Gradle-Plugin) - feature dependency graph visualization and validation

### Git hooks
1. Runs detekt static code analysis and module graph validation before commit. Installation:
   `cp git_hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/ && chmod 0775 .git/hooks/pre-commit`

2. Adds issue prefix in every commit message according to branch name. Installation:
   `cp git_hooks/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/ && chmod 0775 .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`

Or simply run the setup script:

`bash scripts/setup-git-hooks <JIRA_PROJECT_KEY>`

### Geminio templates - creates boilerplate code
1. Read installation instruction root/geminio/SETUP.MD
2. Read user instruction  root/geminio/HOW_TO_USE.MD

### Compose detekt rules docs

### Good coding and happy day!ðŸ¤˜
